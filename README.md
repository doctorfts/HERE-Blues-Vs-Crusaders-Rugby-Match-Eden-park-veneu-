An otherwise mundaneâ€‚Super Rugby Pacific match between the Blues and the Crusaders has become a high-stakes, historic encounter. Weâ€™veâ€‚seen, in recent games, what each team is good at, and how tough they are.
Specifics of a recent game:
Now: Crusaders score a match against Bluesâ€‚22 April 25 Eden Park Crusaders won because they were really well on the attack (3028). Taha Kemara convertedâ€‚some of the tries scored by Sevu Reece, Kyle Preston and Chay Fihaki. Bluesâ€‚scored two tries, one by Dalton Papali'i and one by Finlay Christie. The Crusaders, however, used a betterâ€‚strategy and accordingly their work got missed. The Crusaders definitely won theâ€‚match. They had more runs,â€‚more meters, more clean breaks, more players beaten and more stops than the Blues.
On April 1, 2025 the Crusaders defeated the Blues 42â€“19â€‚at Eden Park. There were plenty of tries, goodâ€‚set pieces and clever kicking on display here. Kyle Preston, Sevu Reece and Tomâ€‚Christie all played paramount roles early in the game that helped set up the Crusaders lead. The Blues tried hard, but simply, the Crusaders wereâ€‚too strong and too quick. In fact they looked the betterâ€‚side for all of the game.
On March 19, 2025, they visited Eden Park to claimâ€‚the Crusaders 41â€“19. Both teams scored tries in the match, but the Crusaders were more clinical and less generous with their defensiveâ€‚line. The Blues started out frontâ€‚but struggled to withstand a barrage of attacks from Fihaki, Williams and Havili.
The relationship between settlers andâ€‚rivalry in the history:
The Crusaders and Blues have met 42â€‚times since the inception of Super Rugby. The teams have played 45 times: the Blues have won 12, the Crusaders have won 32 with aâ€‚game a draw. And in their most recent 18 games, the Crusadersâ€‚have won 17 of them, a formidable record.
This rivalry produces bruising games and memorable playoffs and is builtâ€‚on a history of "bad blood" that is layered with mutual respect. The Crusaders won their 11th Super Rugby title over the Blues in the 2022 finalâ€‚at Eden Park remember. That had happened after the Blues had beenâ€‚winning for a good while.
There are significant head-to-head matchups within games, with the Beauden Barrett vs. Richie Mo'unga ones particularly important, and the outcomes of the games being heavilyâ€‚influenced by the result of Barrett vs. Mo'unga.
2025 Team Progress and Stats:
Indeed, the Crusaders have scored even more runs recently (1,048 to 982)â€‚and made more clean breaks (66 to 41) and beat more defenders (215 to 162) and stops.
Rob Penney, the coaching staff have done a superb job ensuring that their team works hard and does the right things week in andâ€‚week out as they go for the W.
Briefly:
In 2025, the Crusaders have been obviously superior to the Blues in allâ€‚of the matches they played, with all their latest matches having been won comfortably. Super Rugby Pacific is a very competitive league, and so the games have beenâ€‚tough on the bodies, tough to plan for, tough on the emotions. The Crusaders have won more games in the past and more recently, but the Bluesâ€‚remain a tough opponent that can halt that streak
