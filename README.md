Specifics of a recent game:

Taha Kemara converted some of the tries scored by Sevu Reece, Kyle Preston and Chay Fihaki. Blues scored two tries, one by Dalton Papali'i and one by Finlay Christie.

Kyle Preston, Sevu Reece and Tom Christie all played paramount roles early in the game that helped set up the Crusaders lead.

The relationship between settlers and rivalry in the history:
The Crusaders and Blues have met 42 times since the inception of Super Rugby. The teams have played 45 times: the Blues have won 12, the Crusaders have won 32 with a game a draw. And in their most recent 18 games, the Crusaders have won 17 of them, a formidable record.
This rivalry produces bruising games and memorable playoffs and is built on a history of "bad blood" that is layered with mutual respect. The Crusaders won their 11th Super Rugby title over the Blues in the 2022 final at Eden Park remember. That had happened after the Blues had been winning for a good while.
There are significant head-to-head matchups within games, with the Beauden Barrett vs. Richie Mo'unga ones particularly important, and the outcomes of the games being heavily influenced by the result of Barrett vs. Mo'unga.
2025 Team Progress and Stats:
Indeed, the Crusaders have scored even more runs recently (1,048 to 982) and made more clean breaks (66 to 41) and beat more defenders (215 to 162) and stops.
Rob Penney, the coaching staff have done a superb job ensuring that their team works hard and does the right things week in and week out as they go for the W.
Briefly:
In 2025, the Crusaders have been obviously superior to the Blues in all of the matches they played, with all their latest matches having been won comfortably. Super Rugby Pacific is a very competitive league, and so the games have been tough on the bodies, tough to plan for, tough on the emotions. The Crusaders have won more games in the past and more recently, but the Blues remain a tough opponent that can halt that streak
